            <description>
<![CDATA[Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of computer security vulnerability typically found in web applications which allow code injection by malicious web users into the web pages viewed by other users. Examples of such code include HTML code and client-side scripts.]]>            </description>
            <solution>
<![CDATA[The best way to protect a web application from XSS attacks is ensure that the application performs validation of all headers, cookies, query strings, form fields, and hidden fields. Encoding user supplied output in the server side can also defeat XSS vulnerabilities by preventing inserted scripts from being transmitted to users in an executable form. Applications can gain significant protection from javascript based attacks by converting the following characters in all generated output to the appropriate HTML entity encoding:  &lt;, &gt;, &amp;, &quot;, ', (, ), #, %, ; , +, -.]]>            </solution>

<![CDATA[The term CRLF refers to Carriage Return (ASCII 13, \r) Line Feed (ASCII 10, \n). They're used to note the termination of a line, however, dealt with differently in today’s popular Operating Systems. For example: in Windows both a CR and LF are required to note the end of a line, whereas in Linux/UNIX a LF is only required. This combination of CR and LR is used for example when pressing 'Enter' on the keyboard. Depending on the application being used, pressing 'Enter' generally instructs the application to start a new line, or to send a command.]]>            </description>

<![CDATA[The term CRLF refers to Carriage Return (ASCII 13, \r) Line Feed (ASCII 10, \n). They're used to note the termination of a line, however, dealt with differently in today’s popular Operating Systems. For example: in Windows both a CR and LF are required to note the end of a line, whereas in Linux/UNIX a LF is only required. This combination of CR and LR is used for example when pressing 'Enter' on the keyboard. Depending on the application being used, pressing 'Enter' generally instructs the application to start a new line, or to send a command.]]>            </description>

            <description>
<![CDATA[Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of computer security vulnerability typically found in web applications which allow code injection by malicious web users into the web pages viewed by other users. Examples of such code include HTML code and client-side scripts.]]>            </description>
            <solution>
<![CDATA[The best way to protect a web application from XSS attacks is ensure that the application performs validation of all headers, cookies, query strings, form fields, and hidden fields. Encoding user supplied output in the server side can also defeat XSS vulnerabilities by preventing inserted scripts from being transmitted to users in an executable form. Applications can gain significant protection from javascript based attacks by converting the following characters in all generated output to the appropriate HTML entity encoding:  &lt;, &gt;, &amp;, &quot;, ', (, ), #, %, ; , +, -.]]>            </solution>

<![CDATA[The term CRLF refers to Carriage Return (ASCII 13, \r) Line Feed (ASCII 10, \n). They're used to note the termination of a line, however, dealt with differently in today’s popular Operating Systems. For example: in Windows both a CR and LF are required to note the end of a line, whereas in Linux/UNIX a LF is only required. This combination of CR and LR is used for example when pressing 'Enter' on the keyboard. Depending on the application being used, pressing 'Enter' generally instructs the application to start a new line, or to send a command.]]>            </description>

            <description>
<![CDATA[Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of computer security vulnerability typically found in web applications which allow code injection by malicious web users into the web pages viewed by other users. Examples of such code include HTML code and client-side scripts.]]>            </description>
            <solution>
<![CDATA[The best way to protect a web application from XSS attacks is ensure that the application performs validation of all headers, cookies, query strings, form fields, and hidden fields. Encoding user supplied output in the server side can also defeat XSS vulnerabilities by preventing inserted scripts from being transmitted to users in an executable form. Applications can gain significant protection from javascript based attacks by converting the following characters in all generated output to the appropriate HTML entity encoding:  &lt;, &gt;, &amp;, &quot;, ', (, ), #, %, ; , +, -.]]>            </solution>

<![CDATA[The term CRLF refers to Carriage Return (ASCII 13, \r) Line Feed (ASCII 10, \n). They're used to note the termination of a line, however, dealt with differently in today’s popular Operating Systems. For example: in Windows both a CR and LF are required to note the end of a line, whereas in Linux/UNIX a LF is only required. This combination of CR and LR is used for example when pressing 'Enter' on the keyboard. Depending on the application being used, pressing 'Enter' generally instructs the application to start a new line, or to send a command.]]>            </description>

The attacker tries to explore the directories stored in the web server.

            <description>
<![CDATA[Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of computer security vulnerability typically found in web applications which allow code injection by malicious web users into the web pages viewed by other users. Examples of such code include HTML code and client-side scripts.]]>            </description>
            <solution>
<![CDATA[The best way to protect a web application from XSS attacks is ensure that the application performs validation of all headers, cookies, query strings, form fields, and hidden fields. Encoding user supplied output in the server side can also defeat XSS vulnerabilities by preventing inserted scripts from being transmitted to users in an executable form. Applications can gain significant protection from javascript based attacks by converting the following characters in all generated output to the appropriate HTML entity encoding:  &lt;, &gt;, &amp;, &quot;, ', (, ), #, %, ; , +, -.]]>            </solution>

<![CDATA[The term CRLF refers to Carriage Return (ASCII 13, \r) Line Feed (ASCII 10, \n). They're used to note the termination of a line, however, dealt with differently in today’s popular Operating Systems. For example: in Windows both a CR and LF are required to note the end of a line, whereas in Linux/UNIX a LF is only required. This combination of CR and LR is used for example when pressing 'Enter' on the keyboard. Depending on the application being used, pressing 'Enter' generally instructs the application to start a new line, or to send a command.]]>            </description>

            <description>
<![CDATA[Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of computer security vulnerability typically found in web applications which allow code injection by malicious web users into the web pages viewed by other users. Examples of such code include HTML code and client-side scripts.]]>            </description>
            <solution>
<![CDATA[The best way to protect a web application from XSS attacks is ensure that the application performs validation of all headers, cookies, query strings, form fields, and hidden fields. Encoding user supplied output in the server side can also defeat XSS vulnerabilities by preventing inserted scripts from being transmitted to users in an executable form. Applications can gain significant protection from javascript based attacks by converting the following characters in all generated output to the appropriate HTML entity encoding:  &lt;, &gt;, &amp;, &quot;, ', (, ), #, %, ; , +, -.]]>            </solution>

<![CDATA[The term CRLF refers to Carriage Return (ASCII 13, \r) Line Feed (ASCII 10, \n). They're used to note the termination of a line, however, dealt with differently in today’s popular Operating Systems. For example: in Windows both a CR and LF are required to note the end of a line, whereas in Linux/UNIX a LF is only required. This combination of CR and LR is used for example when pressing 'Enter' on the keyboard. Depending on the application being used, pressing 'Enter' generally instructs the application to start a new line, or to send a command.]]>            </description>
