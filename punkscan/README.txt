Code Scope
-----------

PunkSCAN includes and uses a preconfigured, but unmodified version of Apache Nutch 1.5.1 (http://nutch.apache.org/). Apache Nutch is NOT
a product of Hyperion Gray, LLC. Apache Nutch can be found in the root directory under nutch/ in a fairly unadulterated form,
save from a few utility shell scripts and prebuilt config files. The shell scripts produced by Hyperion Gray are clearly
marked as such.

The bulk of the code produced by Hyperion Gray, LLC can be found in the punkscan/ directory. This code is produced by Hyperion 
Gray, LLC unless otherwise marked.
